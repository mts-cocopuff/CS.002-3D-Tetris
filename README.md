<h1>Project Motivation</h1>

<h2>✅ Our Problem Statement</h1>
<p>
  A problem with introducing augmented reality (AR) technology to people is that the features of it are often new and hard to present in an intuitive manner.

  One feature of augmented reality that we showcase is how interacting with a real physical objects affects virtual objects in a 3D environment, creating a more immersive experience than other fully virtual projects.

  In our project, AR is also contextualized by a familiar setting, Tetris. All these factors combined make for a engaging experience that gets the user more familiar with AR.
</p>

<h2>🧑‍🧑‍🧒 Audience</h2>
<p>
  Our project aims to captivate people of all ages, reflecting the addictive nature of Tetris. As was stated in the problem statement, we wanted to focus on people with little or no experience using Augmented/Virtual Reality.

  Given the fact that the main audience for Virtual Reality games are younger people, we wanted to focus on making the gameplay and controls intuitive so that players can pick up the game without looking at a tutorial.
